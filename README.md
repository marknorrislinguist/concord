# concord

Hello, curious linguists!

My goal is for this to contain data and information for my database documenting nominal concord in the world's languages. The term 'nominal concord' refers to cases where modifiers of a noun (e.g., adjectives, numerals, and demonstratives) must change their form (e.g., through affixation or stem change) in order to match certain features of the noun (e.g., gender, number, case). It is only weakly present in English (demonstratives _this_ and _that_ must match the number of the noun they modify), but it is very common in European languages (and, it turns out, African languages and native Australian languages).

For now, data are archived (including in spreadsheet format) at SHAREOK: [Nominal concord](https://shareok.org/handle/11244/320354)
