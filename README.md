# What is concord?

A home for the scripts I write to process/manage the data for the concord typology (static archive at SHAREOK: [Nominal concord](https://shareok.org/handle/11244/320354); new updates archived at OSF: [Nominal concord at OSF](https://osf.io/tm49q/).

## Contents
### conctypo-to-csv.py
Processes individual JSON files and saves the data as one CSV. Command to run the script:

`python conctypo-to-csv.py [-s] [-n] [-d]`

Optional arguments for desired sample (s; options are 'WALS-100', 'WALS-174','Hasp-100' or nothing. Defaults to nothing, which gathers all data),  directory where data is locatied (d; defaults to 'conctypo-data/' in the same folder as the script), and filename for the csv (n; defaults to `conctypo-data.csv`).

### conctypo-data/
Just a small number of sample JSON files to be able to run the code. JSON files for all languages coded so far are available in the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/tm49q/).
